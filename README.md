I worked on a Blinkit sales dataset to understand grocery sales patterns. First, I cleaned the data and explored it using simple charts to see which product categories and outlet types perform better. For example, I found that supermarkets usually sell more compared to small stores.

Then, I built a simple Linear Regression model to predict sales based on product price (MRP). This helped me see that price and outlet type are key factors affecting sales.

Overall, the project shows that I can handle the complete data analysis process â€” from cleaning and exploring data to building a model and finding useful business insights.
